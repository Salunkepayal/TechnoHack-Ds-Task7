Task 7 :-

This script analyzes customer churn data from a telecommunications company. It preprocesses the data, explores its characteristics through visualizations, builds a predictive model using a voting ensemble of classifiers, tunes the model's hyperparameters, evaluates its performance, and provides a function to predict churn probability for new customers. It serves as a robust tool for businesses to understand, anticipate, and address customer churn effectively.
